    "description": "Zombie Ricochet Women Hunter is an action-packed game where the player takes on the role of a skilled hunter, tasked with eliminating hordes of zombies. The aim of the game is simple: eliminate as many zombies as possible while staying alive. The game features custom behavior for the player's hand movements for aiming in all directions, with touching the screen triggering the player to shoot bullets at the targets. The zombies are ruthless and relentless, and the player must stay alert and react quickly to avoid being overwhelmed. One unique feature of the game is the use of physics rag-doll behavior for the enemy zombies. This means that when the player shoots a zombie, their body parts will react realistically and detach from the main body, creating an immersive and satisfying gameplay experience. As the player progresses through the levels, the zombie hordes become increasingly challenging to defeat, with new types of zombies with different abilities and strengths appearing. However, the player can collect power-ups and upgrades to their weapons to aid them in their mission. Overall, Zombie Ricochet Women Hunter is a thrilling and action-packed game that is sure to keep players on the edge of their seats. With its unique game play mechanics and immersive physics-based action, it's a game that is hard to put down.",
